## Ja`Mone Bridges Capstone Project
===================================
## Project Overview

This project centers around the utilization of data science and machine learning to construct an indicator capable of forecasting the future direction of the U.S. economy. The primary focus is to address the issue where numerous organizations, businesses, and individuals are caught off guard by economic changes, resulting in undesirable consequences. By creating a reliable and interpretable indicator, the aim is to empower stakeholders to make informed decisions and preparations in response to economic fluctuations.

## Problem Statement

The challenge at hand is to design an economic indicator with predictive capabilities for the U.S. economy. Economic shifts can often take entities by surprise, leading to a range of adverse outcomes. Timely preparation and informed decision-making can mitigate some of the impact of such unforeseen developments. The objective is to develop an indicator that seamlessly integrates into machine learning models sensitive to economic trends and is also comprehensible to individuals.

## Datasets

The project relies on a collection of macroeconomic datasets provided by various U.S. government departments, including:

- **Federal Reserve**
- **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics**
- **Bureau of Economic Analysis**

These datasets encompass a comprehensive set of economic measurements, including:

- Household Debt
- Household Income
- Household Assets
- Labor Force Statistics
- Unemployment Rates
- Consumer Price Index (CPI)

These datasets serve as the foundational source of information for the indicator, allowing the incorporation of diverse economic factors into our predictive model.

By synthesizing this array of datasets and applying data science techniques, the project seeks to create a tool capable of predicting the future direction of the U.S. economy. Additionally, the goal is to provide individuals and organizations with the means to make decisions to enhanced economic resilience and stability.
